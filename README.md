# Dots Game
This is an interactive Java Applet-based Dots Game that we had developed in 2015. At the outset, the game asks the number of players. Here, if the user selects 2 or more, those many players can play the game. However, if the user selects 1, he/she can play against the computer. 

# How to Run

Since, this is an old application, the latest Java versions don't support it properly. Hence, you can execute this using Exclipse IDE. Steps to follow:

* Open Eclipse IDE.
* Select "File" --> "Open Projects from File System..."
* Select "Directory" and select the directory where you have cloned this repository and select Finish.
* Select "Run" --> "Run Configurations..." 
* Create new "Java Applet" run configuration.
* Under Main, browse and select this project. Under Applet, click "Search" and select the only Applet visible for this folder. 
* You can leave the rest of the tabs unchanged. They won't matter.
* Now, click "Run".
